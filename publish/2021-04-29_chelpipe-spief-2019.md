<p>Radugadesign studio in collaboration with musician Artem ITSU and media artist Alexey Roudenko rethought concept of echo as part of Chelpipe Group stand at IX SPIEF 2019. Together we created an audiovisual instrument where each visitor could influence what was happening inside the stand by voice, pushing multiple controllers and touching the buttons.The music was accompanied by generative visuals in engineering aesthetics.</p>
